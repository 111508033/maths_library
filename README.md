PROJECT TITLE:- "math.h"

MIS :- 111508033

NAME :-  NAGESH DATTU KAMBLE

	I have implemented math.h math library using c. The math.h header defines various mathematical functions. All the functions available in this library take double as an argument and return double as the result. I've also tried to cover other data types like 'float' and 'long double'. 
	The project contains two .c files 'project.c' and 'maths.c' respectively. It also contais 'data' file which is given to test file as a input and contains input and expected output. According to this, it then compares expected o/p and obtained o/p i.e. test cases and then prints the result.
	
	1) project.c   It is the test file which contains test code and takes input from the 'data' file to calculate the result.
	
	2) maths.c  This file contains all the function definitions.

	3) maths.h  It contains alll function prototypes.
